This Lua script is designed to discover networks and hosts within those networks. It uses the `nixio` and `io` libraries to perform its operations. The script was developed and tested on OpenWrt, a Linux operating system targeting embedded devices.

## Functionality

The script contains three main functions: `find_networks()`, `find_hosts(networks)`, and `ping(host)`.

### find_networks()

This function uses the `nixio.getifaddrs()` function to retrieve network interface addresses. It then iterates over these interfaces and extracts the network address for each interface that has one. The network addresses are assumed to be in a /24 subnet. The function returns a table of these network addresses.

### find_hosts(networks)

This function takes a table of network addresses as input. It iterates over these networks and uses the `nmap` command-line tool to scan each network for hosts. The function ignores the loopback network (127.0.0.0/24). For each host found, the function prints the host's IP address and adds it to a table. The function returns this table of hosts.

### ping(host)

This function takes a host IP address as input. It uses the `ping` command-line tool to send a single ping packet to the host. The function then reads the output of the `ping` command and extracts the round-trip time for the ping packet. If the ping was successful, the function returns `true` and the round-trip time. If the ping was not successful, the function returns `false`.

## OpenWrt and Docker Setup

This script is designed to run in a Docker container based on the OpenWrt root file system. The provided Dockerfile sets up the necessary environment, including installing the required packages and setting up the uhttpd web server.

To build the Docker image, run:

```bash
docker build -t openwrt .
```

To start a container from the image, run:

```bash
docker run --network host -v goodstuff:/root -it openwrt /bin/sh
```

This will start a shell in the container, where you can run the script:

```bash
lua 4ping.lua
```

## Dependencies

The Dockerfile installs the following packages:

- lua
- tar
- node
- tcpdump
- nmap
- uhttpd-mod-lua
- luci-lib-nixio

`tar` and `node` are required for the Visual Studio Code Docker extension. If you're not using this extension, you can remove these packages from the Dockerfile.

## VS Code Docker Extension

The development of this script was aided by the use of the Visual Studio Code Docker extension. This extension makes it easy to build, manage, and deploy containerized applications from VS Code.

To install the Docker extension:

1. Open VS Code.
2. Click on the Extensions view icon on the Sidebar (or press `Ctrl+Shift+X`).
3. Search for `Docker`.
4. Click `Install` next to the Docker extension.
